Cosmic Collisions: Milky Way and Andromeda Merger
Overview
This simulation recreates the predicted collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies over billions of years. Users can fast-forward or rewind cosmic time to observe stages of the merger – from first approach, through collisions, to the eventual formation of a new combined galaxy. The visualization shows how two spiral galaxies interact: stars and gas being tugged, new stars igniting, galaxies morphing in shape, and ultimately a stable elliptical galaxy emerging. Educational annotations explain the astrophysical consequences of such galaxy mergers.

Key Stages of the Galactic Merger
Astronomers predict our Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) will begin their encounter about 4 billion years from now​

. The simulation highlights these major stages:

Initial Approach – Present day to 2 billion years in the future: Andromeda draws nearer. At around 2 billion years in the future, it looms larger in our sky​
SCIENCE.NASA.GOV
. The galaxies are still separate, but gravitational interaction is starting. In the simulation’s early timeline, you’d see two distinct spiral galaxies closing the distance between them against a starfield background.

First Encounter & Starburst – ~3.5 to 4 billion years: As the galaxies make their first close pass, tidal forces draw out long tails of stars and gas from each galaxy. Andromeda’s disk begins to stretch and get warped by gravity, and the Milky Way’s spiral structure is disturbed​

. Gas clouds in both galaxies collide and compress, triggering a burst of new star formation – the sky would be “ablaze” with newborn stars​
SCIENCE.NASA.GOV
. In the simulation, this could be visualized by a flare-up of bright blue dots (new massive stars) or sparkles in the interacting region. The user can observe spiral arms being shredded into tidal tails. This stage is chaotic and spectacular, with perhaps even rings or shells of stars forming as the galaxies pass through each other.

Second Pass and Merger – ~5 to 6 billion years: After the first pass, the galaxies may swing around and merge in a second encounter. Their cores spiral toward each other and coalesce. The structure now looks more amorphous; the distinct spiral arms are gone. By about 6 to 7 billion years from now, the two galaxies completely merge into one. The result is a single elliptical galaxy often nicknamed “Milkomeda” by astronomers​

. In the simulation’s final state, you see an elliptical blob of stars with a dense core, instead of the original flat spirals. Any remaining gas might settle into a small disk or feed the central regions, possibly igniting a active galactic nucleus (though that level of detail might be beyond our simulation).

Post-Merger Evolution – 7+ billion years: The new merged galaxy stabilizes as an elliptical. Star formation slows down due to gas depletion. The orbits of stars have randomized, giving the galaxy its elliptical shape. In the very far future, the simulation could show this merged galaxy interacting with the next nearest neighbor (perhaps the Triangulum Galaxy joining in, as some simulations predict​
SCIENCE.NASA.GOV
). But the primary focus is on the Milky Way-Andromeda event.

Throughout each stage, the simulation can display the time in the future (e.g., “T = 3.8 billion years”) to orient the user. They can scrub through the timeline or play it to watch the collision unfold.

Implementation Approach
Modeling an entire galaxy with hundreds of billions of stars is infeasible in real-time, so the simulation uses simplified, representative models:

Particle Representation of Galaxies: Each galaxy can be represented by a few thousand particles that mimic the distribution of stars. For example, one could generate points following a disk profile for the spirals (perhaps using a spiral arm formula for Milky Way and a more diffuse disk for Andromeda) plus a central bulge. These particles move under gravity. We use Newtonian gravity (each particle attracted to every other) to simulate the dynamics – this is an N-body simulation. To make it efficient, one might use a Barnes-Hut approximation (treat distant groups of stars as a single mass) so that O(N log N) calculations keep things fast. However, with a few thousand particles total, even direct computation can run at interactive rates in Python with optimized libraries or by lowering time step/resolution. Tools like NumPy for vectorized computations or even Barnes-Hut implementations in Python can be employed.

Time Stepping: The user-controlled time slider determines how fast the simulation time advances. We might use a smaller time step when the slider is slow (for accuracy) and larger steps when fast-forwarding (sacrificing some accuracy for speed). When the user pauses or steps to a specific time, the simulation can either jump to a precomputed state or integrate to that point. (For a smooth interactive experience, one approach is to precompute the key frames of the simulation – using a slower but detailed offline calculation or loading data from a known simulation – then interpolate between frames as the user scrubs. However, this requires a lot of data. Instead, many interactive simulations integrate on the fly, which is what we’ll assume here.)

Gravity Calculation: Initially, the two galaxies start far apart with slight mutual gravitational attraction. We give Andromeda an initial velocity toward the Milky Way (based on estimates ~110 km/s radial approach​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
, scaled to our units). As the simulation runs, each particle’s acceleration is computed by $ \mathbf{a} = -G \sum_{j} m_j \frac{\mathbf{r}{ij}}{|\mathbf{r}{ij}|^3}$, summing over all (or aggregated) other masses. We update velocities and positions (using, say, a Leapfrog integrator for stability). Over time, you’ll see the two clusters of particles (galaxies) draw together, tidal tails form as some particles gain velocity and get flung out, and eventually the cores merge.

Star Formation: In real galaxy mergers, star formation bursts occur when gas clouds collide. To emulate this, the simulation can have a criterion: when two particles from different galaxies come very close (within a threshold distance), we “spawn” new star particles. These new stars could be represented by a different color (e.g., bright blue or white) and maybe have a limited lifetime of high brightness. We don’t track gas explicitly, but this rule gives a visual cue of bursts of stars. Alternatively, as a simpler approach, we can calculate the local density of particles: when a region’s particle density exceeds a certain threshold (indicating the galaxies overlapping), create some new particles to signify star formation. Those new stars might gradually fade or just remain as part of the particle set. The key is that by the time of the first encounter (around 3.8–4 billion years in the future), the simulation shows many new stars forming in the overlapping region​

. This addresses the educational point that collisions trigger star birth.

Merger and Dynamic Friction: As the galaxy cores (which we can represent with a few massive particles each) come together, they might just fly apart again if no energy is dissipated. In reality, dynamic friction (interactions between many particles) and tidal stripping remove energy, so the galaxies merge rather than pass through endlessly. In our code, ensuring a merger might mean slightly increasing drag or just relying on enough particles to exchange energy. We can also inelasticly merge the two supermassive black hole particles at the centers if they get within a certain range, to form one center (this would be an advanced detail – could produce gravitational wave info, but that’s beyond our scope).

Education Annotations: To provide insights on astrophysical consequences, the simulation can display text or graphics at certain milestones. For example, when the starburst occurs, a caption might pop up: “Starburst: Gas collisions trigger rapid star formation!” When the galaxies officially merge, a note can say: “Galaxies have merged into an elliptical. Many stars thrown into new orbits.” These can be triggered by the time or state (e.g., when relative distance of galaxy centers drops below a threshold).

Visualization and User Interaction
Graphics: We can use Matplotlib or Pygame/VPython to render the particles (stars). Matplotlib’s animation functionality could create a scatter plot updating each frame, but for real-time interactivity, a gaming library or VPython might be smoother. Pygame can draw thousands of small dots (for stars) each frame, which is feasible if optimized (using surfaces or sprites). VPython (or GlowScript) would allow 3D visualization – the user could even rotate the view to see the collision from different angles. In 2D (projecting onto the plane of the galaxy), the visualization would likely be a top-down view of the galaxies. This shows the spiral structure and eventual elliptical shape clearly. Optionally, an edge-on view could illustrate how the product is more spheroidal after merger. We might allow toggling views.

Color and Size Encoding: Use color to differentiate the two galaxies’ original stars (e.g., Milky Way stars colored yellow, Andromeda’s blue). New stars formed during the collision could be bright white or another standout color. As time progresses, perhaps color-code star ages (new ones bright, then dimming to the color of older stars). This creates a visually appealing scene and also encodes information. The core regions can be shown as a concentrated bright area. If using 3D, slight transparency or smaller size for distant stars can give depth.

Time Control: A timeline slider lets users scrub through billions of years. Pressing play will run the simulation continuously, but the user can pause at any point. There could also be buttons for specific events (“Go to first pass”, “Go to merger completion”). While paused, the user might step frame-by-frame (like tens of millions of years per step) to examine details. The current simulation time is displayed in a label. To cover the full 7+ billion year scenario at reasonable speed, the simulation’s clock might run in steps of tens of millions of years per second by default (adjustable via the slider).

Educational Labels: As part of being educational, the interface can label structures – for instance, when tidal tails form, an arrow with text “Tidal Tail” can point to the stream of stars being pulled out. When the galaxies merge, label the new combined core. Perhaps an inset or overlay can display fun facts, like “Did you know? Despite the galaxies colliding, almost no individual stars will hit each other due to the vast distances between them!” In fact, the simulation can explicitly demonstrate this: you might highlight two particular stars on a collision course and show how they pass by each other. Collisions between stars are incredibly unlikely because of the huge interstellar spaces; the stars simply remix gravitationally​
SCIENCE.NASA.GOV
. Our simulation can show stars passing by without contact, yet their paths diverging due to gravitational slingshots. Some stars even get ejected from the system entirely, flung into intergalactic space (the code would naturally produce some escapers due to the violence of the interaction, and we can mark them in a different color or trail). This touches on the consequence that the merger will fling some stars (possibly our Sun) into new orbits far from the center​

.

Final Outcome: Once the merger is complete, the simulation could fade out the scene into an image of an elliptical galaxy for comparison, or simply let the user fly around the final star distribution. A summary might read: “Result: one elliptical galaxy (Milkomeda) – former spiral structures gone, central supermassive black holes now merged, likely a quiescent future with slow star formation.”

By adjusting the parameters (for instance, the angle of the collision or speed – though in our scenario it’s a fixed nature, we could let users experiment with a faster/slower approach or an off-center collision to see how that changes the merger), users get a hands-on feel for galaxy dynamics. The simulation helps convey why galactic collisions trigger starbursts​
SCIENCE.NASA.GOV
, how tidal forces create tails, and how an elliptical galaxy can form from spirals​
SCIENCE.NASA.GOV
. Crucially, it also illustrates that while galaxies merge, individual stars mostly don’t collide – instead, they move under gravity to new positions​

Both the black hole and galaxy collision simulations use Python’s capabilities to blend physics and visualization. Using libraries like Pygame or VPython for interactivity and Matplotlib for plotting or analysis, these simulations can be made highly interactive and visually engaging. Through them, learners can experiment with extreme cosmic phenomena in a hands-on way, deepening their understanding of general relativity and galactic astronomy. Each simulation remains faithful to real physics, backed by data and scenarios astronomers have studied, ensuring an educational experience that is as authentic as it is exciting.
